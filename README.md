# Running the Notebook in Google Colab
You can run this project entirely in the cloud using Google Colab, with options to use your dataset either from your local device or from your Google Drive.

🧭 Option 1: Open the Notebook in Colab
Click the badge below to launch the notebook directly in Google Colab:


📝 Replace yourusername and lung_cancer.ipynb with your actual GitHub username and notebook name.

📁 Accessing the Dataset in Colab
🔹 Method 1: Upload from Your Local Device
If the dataset is small, you can upload it directly:
python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
After uploading, the file can be read using pandas:
python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

🔹 Method 2: Load from Google Drive
For large datasets or persistent access:
python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Then access your file like:
python
data_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/path_to_your_dataset/your_dataset.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
Make sure the dataset is already uploaded to your Google Drive.

🔹 Method 3: Download from a Public URL
If your dataset is hosted online:

python
Copy
Edit
!wget https://example.com/your_dataset.csv
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
🧪 Installing Additional Packages
Google Colab includes most common libraries, but to install others:
python
!pip install package_name
Example:
python
!pip install xgboost
💾 Saving Files (Models, Outputs, etc.)
To download a file created in Colab:

python
from google.colab import files
files.download("output_file.csv")
To save to Google Drive instead:

python
df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/output_file.csv', index=False)
